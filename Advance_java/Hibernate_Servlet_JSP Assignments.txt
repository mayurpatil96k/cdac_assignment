1) 
	generate an entity class "Dept" inside "mypack"
using reverse engg technique.

Data.jsp -> DataServlet 

	in jsp u need to have

	Search By loc:-  <textfield>

		<submit>

user will enter "location" and click on submit. Request will go to DataServlet , which will search records from database where location is  the one entered by user (using HQL). This will give a servlet List which will contain "Dept" objects for matching condition.

servlet will store this List inside "request" attribute and forward it to the same jsp i.e. "Data.jsp" from where u have come inside servlet.

Data.jsp will display the arraylist using EL and JSTL.


2) create an entity "Student" with
	int rollno   [ id ]
	String name
	String address

create an interface

		StudentDAO with method
	void addStudent(Student)
	

create two implementations

	StudentDAOFileImpl.java
		which will persist given student inside file using serialization.

	StudentDAODataImpl.java
		which will persist given student inside database using hibernate.


Add.jsp

	Enter student name:
	Enter student address
		
		Select persistence store: dropdown
			with values

				file 
				database

		submit

on submit control should go to "AddServlet"

AddServlet will have a reference to 

	StudentDAO sdao;
the idea here is that "sdao" can point to any implementation of "StudentDAO" and invoke "addStudent()" polymorphically.

inside doPost() method 
a) instantiate "Student" with the values provided by user.
b) u will check the persistence store selected by user.
if this is "file"
	set the rollno.
	servlet will instantiate "StudentDAOFileImpl" and invoke "addStudent()" method.

if this is "data"
	servlet will instantiate "StudentDAODataImpl" and invoke "addStudent()" method.
